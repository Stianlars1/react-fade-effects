      variant="up"

## Future Components

This package is designed to expand with additional fade components, such as:

- **FadeChildren**: Apply fade-in effects to child elements within a container.
- **FadeImages**: Animate image elements with fade effects.
- **FadeContainers**: Apply fades to entire sections or containers.

Each future component will come with its own set of customizable props, following the same flexible design as `FadeWords`.
